# Project Description 

In this project I will investigate the World Heritage Site Ha Long Bay, located in Vietnam. Specifically, I will investigate the following question:

*How might the oceanic conditions surrounding Ha Long Bay affect the karsts physically over time?*

The objectives of this experiment are to explore and quantify how tidal currents, waves, and seawater chemistry erode karst formations in Ha Long Bay. Additionally, I would like to model long-term karst retreat rates under climate change and
identify mixing spots where dissolution is maximized. My model will focus on the region of Ha Long Bay located between Ca Bat Island and Bai Tu Long Bay, at 20.8°–21.2°N, 106.7°–107.3°E and will be ran for a decade. To show the role that the ocean plays in eroding the karst formations, two models will be run. One model contains tidal forces while the other doesn't. The model will be ran starting from January, 2004. I think that the model without tidal forces will have result in lower mixed-layer depths and lower sediment transport rates due to the decreased erosion activity.

To initialize the model, I will utilize data from the ECCO Version 5 in January of 2004, which will also be used to to construct the boundary and external forcing conditions. To visualize the results, two time series of each model will be created to allow for analysis through time. Additionally, several frames of graphs will be made into a movie, thus allowing for a visual comparison as to how oceanic conditions have an effect on the karst formations at Ha Long Bay.
