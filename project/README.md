# Project Description 

In this project I will investigate the World Heritage Site Ha Long Bay, located in Vietnam. Specifically, I will investigate the following question:

*How do the karst formations of Ha Long Bay influence local tidal mixing and water renewal times?*

To explore this question, I will run a model for one year in the Ha Long Bay region spanning between Ca Hat Island to Bai Tu Long Bay with two variations, 
one that includes complex topography and data from the real life Ha Long Bay, and an idealized version with the karst formations that make up Ha Long Bay absent.

I will initialize my model in 2012 as an arbitrary start date using the [fill in when final source of data is decided upon]. 
To analyze and demonstrate the analysis and results, I will create a time series showcasing the differences in todal mixing and renewal times in the region, highlighting the impact that the topography has on the local area.
